Registry of MDAnalysis Toolkits (MDAKits)
=========================================
The MDAKit registry contains a list of all MDAKits which have been voluntarily added to this repository. The aim of this registry is to provide sufficient details to allow others to use and potentially participate in the development of the MDAKits. Each of the following links provides more information about what the MDAKits do, how they can be installed and how to participate in their development. We also provide a set of badges which detail the current status of the MDAKits.
